Issues got
script returned exit code 1619
While installing through jenkins log files in temp is not created
If we checkout an empty .svn file is created in the directory if files contained folder checkout then the directory is created.



Challenges Faced:
Required MSI files or to be installed files should be in the Job working directory  --- > For 2 job Patch and Media should be placed separately  ----> This can be overcome by using multi line comment ''' ''' in jenkins
Patch Installing is failed due to Admin rights (To be Overcome)


Troubleshooting:
If installation got issue restart/start the windowsinstaller in services
